                        Welcome here stranger! I'm a software engineer who loves to build things for
                        the web. I'm currently working on some cool projects and learning new
                        technologies. I'm also open to new opportunities, so feel free to contact me
                        if you want to work together.
                    </p>

                    Or don't, it's up to you. I'm not your boss. Kidding, I'm your boss now. Play
                    the game. But, wait, it seems like the game is not working. I guess you have to
                    check out my projects instead.
